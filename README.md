ampliMethProfiler tool provides an easy and user friendly way to extract and analyze the epihaplotype composition of reads from targeted bisulfite sequencing experiments.
Specifically, ampliMethProfiler provides an easy and user friendly way to extract and analyze the epiallelic composition of reads from targeted bisulfite sequencing experiments. ampliMethProfiler is written in python language and requires a local installation of BLAST and QIIME tools. It can be run on Linux and OS X platforms.
